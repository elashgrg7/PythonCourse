#3.4.11

#Scenario
#The Beatles were one of the most popular music groups of the 1960s, 
#and the best-selling band in history. Some people consider them to be the most influential
#act of the rock era. Indeed, they were included in Time magazine's compilation of 
#the 20th Century's 100 most influential people.

#The band underwent many line-up changes, culminating in 1962 with the line-up of:
#John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Richard Starkey (better known as Ringo Starr).


#Write a program that reflects these changes and lets you practice with the concept of lists. Your task is to:

    #step 1: create an empty list named beatles;
    #step 2: use the append() method to add the following members of the band to the list: 
        #John Lennon, Paul McCartney, and George Harrison;
    #step 3: use the for loop and the append() method to prompt the user to add:
        #the following members of the band to the list: Stu Sutcliffe, and Pete Best;
    #step 4: use the del instruction to remove Stu Sutcliffe and Pete Best from the list;
    #step 5: use the insert() method to add Ringo Starr to the beginning of the list.

#By the way, are you a Beatles fan? (The Beatles is one of Greg's favorite bands. 
#But wait...who's Greg...?)

#3.6.6

#Scenario

#Imagine a list ‒ not very long, not very complicated, just a simple list containing some 
#integer numbers. Some of these numbers may be repeated, and this is the clue.
#We don't want any repetitions. We want them to be removed.

#Your task is to write a program which:
    #removes all the number repetitions from the list.
    #The goal is to have a list in which all the numbers appear not more than once.

#Note: assume that the source list is hard-coded inside the code ‒ you don't have to 
    #enter it from the keyboard. Of course, you can improve the code and add a part that 
    #can carry out a conversation with the user and obtain all the data from her/him.

#Hint: we encourage you to create a new list as a temporary work area ‒ you don't need 
#to update the list in situ.

my_list = [1, 2, 4, 4, 1, 4, 2, 6, 2, 9]

#u_list will be blank to begin with.
u_list = []


#This will check whether my_list[i] "is not present" in u_list. If the condition is True my_list[i] is appended to u_list.
for i in range(len(my_list)):
    if my_list[i] not in u_list:
        u_list.append(my_list[i])

print("The list with unique elements only:")
print(u_list)
