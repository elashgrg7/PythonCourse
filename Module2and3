#2.6.1.10

#Your task is to complete the code in order to evaluate the following expression:
#The result should be assigned to y. Be careful - watch the operators and keep their priorities in mind. Don't hesitate to use as many parentheses as you need.
#You can use additional variables to shorten the expression (but it's not necessary). Test your code carefully.


#2.6.1.11

#Your task is to prepare a simple code able to evaluate the end time of a period of time, given as a number of minutes (it could be arbitrarily large). The start time is given as a pair of hours (0..23) and minutes (0..59). The result has to be printed to the console.
#For example, if an event starts at 12:17 and lasts 59 minutes, it will end at 13:16.
#Don't worry about any imperfections in your code - it's okay if it accepts an invalid time - the most important thing is that the code produce valid results for valid input data.
#Test your code carefully. Hint: using the % operator may be the key to success.


#3.1.1.4

#Using one of the comparison operators in Python, write a simple two-line program that takes the parameter n as input, which is an integer, and prints False if n is less than 100, and True if n is greater than or equal to 100.
#Don't create any if blocks (we're going to talk about them very soon). Test your code using the data we've provided for you.
