#Your task is to complete the code in order to evaluate the following expression:
#The result should be assigned to y. Be careful ‒ watch the operators and keep their priorities in mind. Don't hesitate to use as many parentheses as you need.
#You can use additional variables to shorten the expression (but it's not necessary). Test your code carefully.

y = 1/(x+1/(x+1/(x+1/x)))                    #Broken down the calculation into smaller chunks and started building the expression from the right

#Your task is to prepare a simple code able to evaluate the end time of a period of time, given as a number of minutes (it could be arbitrarily large). The start time is given as a pair of hours (0..23) and minutes (0..59). The result has to be printed to the console.
#For example, if an event starts at 12:17 and lasts 59 minutes, it will end at 13:16.
#Don't worry about any imperfections in your code ‒ it's okay if it accepts an invalid time ‒ the most important thing is that the code produces valid results for valid input data.
#Test your code carefully. Hint: using the % operator may be the key to success.
