#A junior magician has picked a secret number. He has hidden it in a variable named secret_number. 
#He wants everyone who runs his program to play the Guess the secret number game, and guess what number he has picked for them. 
# Those who don't guess the number will be stuck in an endless loop forever! Unfortunately, he does not know how to complete the code.

#Your task is to help the magician complete the code in the editor in such a way so that the code:

    #will ask the user to enter an integer number;
    #will use a while loop;
    #will check whether the number entered by the user is the same as the number picked by the magician. If the number chosen by the user is different than the magician's secret number, 
    #the user should see the message "Ha ha! You're stuck in my loop!" and be prompted to enter a number again. If the number entered by the user matches the number picked by the magician, 
    #the number should be printed to the screen, and the magician should say the following words: "Well done, muggle! You are free now."
    #The magician is counting on you! Don't disappoint him.

secret_number = 777

#Do you know what Mississippi is? Well, it's the name of one of the states and rivers in the United States. 
#The Mississippi River is about 2,340 miles long, which makes it the second longest river in the United States (the longest being the Missouri River). 
#It's so long that a single drop of water needs 90 days to travel its entire length!

#The word Mississippi is also used for a slightly different purpose: to count mississippily.

#If you're not familiar with the phrase, we're here to explain to you what it means: it's used to count seconds.

#The idea behind it is that adding the word Mississippi to a number when counting seconds aloud makes them sound closer to clock-time,
#and therefore "one Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi" will take approximately an actual three seconds of time! It's often used by children playing hide-and-seek to make sure the seeker does an honest count.

#Your task is very simple here: write a program that uses a for loop to "count mississippily" to five. Having counted to five, the program should print to the screen the final message "Ready or not, here I come!"

#The break statement is used to exit/terminate a loop.

#Design a program that uses a while loop and continuously asks the user to enter a word unless the user enters "chupacabra" as the secret exit word, 
#in which case the message "You've successfully left the loop." should be printed to the screen, and the loop should terminate.

#Don't print any of the words entered by the user. Use the concept of conditional execution and the break statement.

from getpass import getpass

code = getpass("Enter the password:")

while True:
    if code != "chupacabra":
        code = getpass("Enter the password:")
    
    else:
        print("You've successfully left the loop.")
        break
