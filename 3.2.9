#3.2.9


#The break statement is used to exit/terminate a loop.

#Design a program that uses a while loop and continuously asks the user to enter a word unless the user enters "chupacabra" as the secret exit word, 
#in which case the message "You've successfully left the loop." should be printed to the screen, and the loop should terminate.

#Don't print any of the words entered by the user. Use the concept of conditional execution and the break statement.

from getpass import getpass

code = getpass("Enter the password:"

while True:
    if code != "chupacabra":
        counter -= 1
        code = getpass("Enter the password:")
        
        print("You now have", counter, "attemps left.")
    
    else:
        print("You've successfully left the loop.")
        break
